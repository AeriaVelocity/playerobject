   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION 

1. You are not permitted to use this software in any way, shape, or form.

                          OKAY, BUT SERIOUSLY
           
This license is a satire. Ensure you DO NOT use the IMTTPPO license in ANY work
unless you're just having a laugh or something. Or maybe you actually don't want
anyone to use your stuff. In which case, go right ahead.

None of this is professional, by the way.
